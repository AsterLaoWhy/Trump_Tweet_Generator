TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem. The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @ BarackObama in today\\'s debt talks--First and foremost CUT,CAP and BALANCE.THe Art of the Deal--\"The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have.\" CUT, CAP and BALANCE.If only @ Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel\\'s borders then America would be on the path to solvency.@johnboehner Message for House GOP \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.\" The Art of the Deal.@ Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq?

Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa.com # TeenUSA@ BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt. T-E- marcorubio is right. We need to create more taxpayers, not more taxes. CUT, CAP AND BALANCE. to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday. # trumpvlog The Republicans must act now, don\\'t let @ barackobama push you around.... BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd Amendment rights. Every dollar @ BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren\\'s backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!The GOP doesn\\'t waste an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal. So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit... How low have we as a nation sunk?@johnboehner @ EricCantor \" You can\\'t con people...if you don\\'t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.\" The Art of the DealWhile @ BarackObama seeks to further destroy our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.   Obamacare is The Biggest Tax Increase In U.S. History--repeal it as part of any deal. Check out  Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly. Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it. \"China is our enemy--they want to destroy us\" -- Redstate InterviewWe could use the Balanced Budget Amendment--Politicians don\\'t have the will to cut spending. \"The Gang of Six\" - yet another unmitigated disaster. ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. T-E-A.My interview on @ gretawire last night - \"Our Leaders Are Leading Us Into \\'Oblivion\\' \" America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally.\" - US Senator @ BarackObama, 2007Ronald Kessler\\'s new book \"The Secrets of the FBI\" is a great book that should be read by everyone. Unfortunately@BarackObama\\'s continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad thingsWe need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline. The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly. The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @ BarackObama....   # trumpvlogObama, sadly, has no business or private sector background---and it shows. Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors. My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox...  # trumpvlogMy interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends -- \"GOP Crazy If They Don\\'t Get Everything They Want\"  debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking. China has so much of our debt that they can\\'t put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast!Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste. Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @ QVC at 1 a.m. So proud of her!\"Know when to walk away from the table.

Didn\\'t Bush do the same thing?Please tweet me your questions to answer in my # trumpvlog.@Johnboehner \"The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.\" --The Art of the DealMy wife Melania Trump\\'s show was a tremendous success last night. In case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @ QVC at 7 pm ET@ BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet. He\\'s totally lost, ineffective, desperate. GOP has its best chance to make a great dealI appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee, a fine American  just got Mike Leach\\'s new book, Swing Your Sword. He\\'s a great coach, and he\\'s written a great book. It\\'s definitely worth reading. \"Never quit and always hit back\" -- The Art of the ComebackBlue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? Bad idea. If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses -- \"Watch the fine details in every deal\" -- The Art of the DealWatched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy. No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America. We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem. Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure. Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is a mistake. This is the best deal the Republicans could get?Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal? America must remain strong. How does this deal help strengthen the US?Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems.

Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times. OPEC continues to rip us off. Not worth $30. New leadership needed. The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars. Wrong move. My interview from yesterday with # Apprentice Andy on @ AmericaNowRadio  was on CNBC this morning talking about the market and America\\'s financial future  forward to the GOP debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader. How will Mitt Romney defend his record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight\\'s debate?It\\'s easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties. My interview on @ AmericaNowRadio with Andy Dean. Andy was a contestant on the second season of The Apprentic… (cont)   has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government. Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy. Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America. Reporters say it\\'s the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up.@ BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha\\'s Vineyard. Nice work ethic. My thoughts on the Republican Party in today\\'s # trumpvlog...  is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths. Very troubling. China is a threat to America. They are not our friend. I was interviewed by Greta Van Susteren today here at Trump Tower.

My interview this morning on Good Morning America with George Stephanopoulos  BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating. Why so high?My interview with @ gretawire on Fox News for those who missed it - \\' Obama\\'s Constantly on Vacation\\' Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan.@ MacMiller will enjoy today\\'s # trumpvlog...  Rove --lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House--gave us Obama. Many people have been asking to see my plane, The Apprentice\\'s @ AmandaTMiller will give you a tour...  in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks---US wastes trillions. You can listen to my interview today with Jay Sekulow Live and the @ JordanSekulow show here  @ 12PM EST.@ BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1. Not create any jobs. 2. Borrow more money from China.@ BarackObama is sure a master delegator. He has sent @ Joe_Biden to China. The Chinese are laughing at us. We MUST do better. Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently. They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens. While @ BarackObama continues to defend ObamaCare in the courts, he is also granting companies waivers. Eve… (cont)  should have told the so-called rebels “We will only help if you give us 50% of your oil.”   # trumpvlogWe don\\'t need another stimulus. The first one was a complete failure. Why repeat the same mistake?@ RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration. Wrong for media to ignore him. We spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil?Let\\'s not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over. As bad as Qaddafi was---what comes next in Libya will be worse---just watch. Just as I predicted, @ Joe_Biden was a complete disaster in China. He condoned the Chinese one-child policy an… (cont)  have spent over $1 Billion on the Libya operation. What are we getting back?There usually is an easy solution to every problem. For instance, a lot of our country\\'s problems can be solved in next year\\'s election.@ BarackObama inherited $10.6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17.6 Trillion. China\\'s corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy. With the right leadership, it can be stopped. America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People. I\\'m very proud of the work my son @ EricTrump has been doing with the @ EricTrumpFDN, take a look...  did @ BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha\\'s Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers\\' dime. There is no substitute for private sector experience. More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties----I agree. Hurricane Irene and Libya in today\\'s # trumpvlog....   Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support---we don\\'t even ask!Iran admits to aiding the Libyan \"Rebels\" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn?   BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution. Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off. If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding. Actions have consequences. ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America\\'s small businesses. The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now. China\\'s business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders. We need to reassess our relationship.@ BarackObama transparently had ATF head Kenneth Melson resign yesterday.... Fast and Furious obviously goes all the way to the White House. My thoughts on Dick Cheney and his new book…  # trumpvlogLibya is being taken over by Islamic radicals---with @ BarackObama\\'s open support. With gas prices rising and the economy failing, @ BarackObama seeks to have his EPA raise energy prices by $109B  be on Greta Van Susteren\\'s show tonight at 10 PM on FoxNews. Tune in. We must stand firm against the UN\\'s ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it. My interview with @ gretawire last night -- \"Everything Obama Does is a \\'Campaign Speech\\'\" BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th. Just sad. Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House. The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher. Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @ BarackObama should answer all questions. Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @ BarackObama. Fast and Furious gun running goes all the way to the White House. We need answers now!@ BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs. His job is costing America all of ours. The UN is about to use its Assembly to attack @ Israel. We should defund the UN entirely if they can\\'t act resp… (cont)  BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs -- instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment. USA should take oil from Iraq in repayment for their liberation. should have told Libya \"Rebels\" --- give us 50% of your oil for our military support. A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors. Why was @ BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers?America needs a tough negotiator---not a community organizer. My interview with @ gretawire last night on @ FoxNews: @ BarackObama \\'Missed His Opportunity\\' interview yesterday with @ IngrahamAngle   only speeches could create jobs then @ BarackObama wouldn\\'t have such a dismal economic record. China is happy to learn that @ BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @ BarackObama is their favorite client. Why is the UN planning to attack @ Israel\\'s sovereignty and ignore Iran\\'s nuclear program? The US should look at future funding.@ IvankaTrump always makes me  watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old \"tax and spend\" won\\'t create jobs.@ BarackObama---the stimulus will fail, just like the first. Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate. Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US. America will boom. Very exciting. I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal!Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary. The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world. We have fallen from first under @ BarackObama.

My @ FoxNews interview last night on @ gretawire -- \"On 2012: I\\'ll Wait and See\" Solyndra Scandal-- @ BarackObama\\'s $500Million photo op. He loves wasting our money. Can you imagine if @ BarackObama had passed Cap and Trade?! Energy costs would be double from already record highs. We can create jobs in the American economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector. I applaud @ netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the UN to defend @ Israel. A true US friend and great leader.@ BarackObama -- honored and excited to be listed on @ AttackWatch. Thanks. BTW -- where are the jobs? Donald.@ BarackObama---great job on Solyndra. You are some extremely skilled venture capitalist. Stick to the memoirs and speeches. \"It doesn\\'t cost any money to think bigger.\" -- The Art of the DealMy thoughts on the Emmys in today\\'s # trumpvlog....

Iran is a threat to our national security. The Misery Index is at a 28 year high. Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend. The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed\\'s recklessness is going to lead to record inflation. We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. We should be reimbursed with oil! -- Don\\'t give it to Iran.

We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake. Watch me tonight at 9PM ET on @ CNN, full hour. @ Piersmorgan won @ ApprenticeNBC before taking over Larry King\\'s slot- should be interesting. The Debt is our nation\\'s greatest threat. @ BarackObama is out of touch. When will our nation\\'s sacrifices be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil. Our worst threat to unemployment is @ ObamaCare. It will also destroy our country\\'s basic standards. The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya. My interview yesterday with @ TeamCavuto discussing Europe\\'s debt deal and the GOP  interview from last night with @ piersmorgan discussing  contains marriage penalty taxes.

The @ SuperCommittee must cut spending, not raise taxes. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Why is @ BarackObama letting the Taliban know when our troops are leaving?   This is dangerous for our soldiers. Egypt\\'s Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza. Why did @ BarackObama promote the \"Arab Spring\"?The economy won\\'t fully recover until @ ObamaCare is fully repealed. It is a job killer!The greatest threat to our security is our debt.

This is unsustainable and a true danger. The American dream is being destroyed. Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem. Some @ OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party. America should not be pressuring @ Israel to show restraint against Iran. We should be working to stop Iran\\'s nuclear drive. Instead of trash talking @ PMIsrael on the world stage, @ BarackObama should be defending @ Israel. The @ SuperCommittee will fail.

Is this @ BarackObama’s ‘recovery’? BarackObama delayed the Keystone pipeline decision until 2013. Now Canada is looking to export more oil to China.   Americans are now insured through their employers due to higher premiums. Obamacare must be fully repealed. BarackObama has already added $5 Trillion to the national debt in less than 3 years.

One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @ GOP can\\'t be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire. Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero. It is very sad to see what @ BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians.\" realDonaldTrump: @ MittRomney Has \\'Tremendous Heart,\\' Will Save Medicare  via @Newsmax_MediaLook what happened to the autism rate from 1983-2008 since one-time massive shots were given to children- succeed, because they think they can.\" -- Virgil. @ BarackObama has completely failed the American people. U.S. annual incomes have fallen over 5% during his  the Democrats want to attack \\'Birthers\\' then they should at least spell it  silent when @ BarackObama called @ MittRomney a murderer & felon. Mitt mentions \\'birth certificate\\' and they go nuts. Double standard!As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines & ratings!The US Navy wants to go \"green. \" Our Navy should use the best & most powerful fuel & not play games. Give me a break!. FinancialTimes writes that \" @ BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US\"  Don\\'t worry, he is making it happen.. @ ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision. Don\\'t think my statement on @ ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow. The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns. A total mess. We should build our own bridges, etcMy @ FoxNews @ TeamCavuto interview discussing the @ RNC Convention, businesses making products in China and  @ RobinRoberts everyone adores you- including me- get well fast!Ask China if their rapidly expanding (with our money ) Navy or Armed Forces are going \"green\" -- They would laugh in your face!\"Trump urges GOP to be \\'mean as hell\\'\"  Via @ CNNPoliticsRemember when @ ariannahuff ran for Governor of California. She got 3 votes. Happy to hear that @ ralphreed\\'s Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @ RNC convention supporting @ MittRomney. We must be united to win!. MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @ AnnDRomney\\'s speech tonight. She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady!. @ GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @ MittRomney should be elected and @ BarackObama has to go. It\\'s Tuesday--how much inflation has @ BarackObama\\'s spending caused today on the price of food and gas?\"I stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. \" -- @ MittRomney. @ BarackObama\\'s Super PAC has continually called @ MittRomney a \"murderer\"  Ironic since Obama is destroying Medicare. I can\\'t wait to read this... RT @Newsmax_Media: SEAL Book Explodes, Obama Furious  am very worried that if @ BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.. @ BarackObama\\'s dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November. What a coincidence--Michelle Obama called Kenya @ BarackObama\\'s \"homeland\" in 2008  must be worried that @ MittRomney will win this November. They have never had such a pushover like @ BarackObama. An excerpt of my @ TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota \\'Statesman of the Year\\' dinner discussing the Tea Party  to @ AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night. America can\\'t wait to call her our First Lady. My @ SquawkCNBC # TrumpTuesday interview discussing the 2012 election, OPEC ripping us off & @ MittRomney\\'s job  speech by my good friend @ GovChristie. He did something you won\\'t hear at @ BarackObama\\'s convention---tell the truth. It\\'s Wednesday, how much money is China stealing from us today?\"New business start-ups at the lowest level in 30 years and the EPA is now the Employment Prevention Agency. \" -- @ bobmcdonnell\"No one will work harder. No one will move heaven and earth like Mitt Romney to make this country a better place to live!\" -- @ AnnDRomney\"America needs @ MittRomney and @ PaulRyanVP and we need them right now. \" -- @ GovChristieI am astonished that the media continues to lie. @ BarackObama gutted welfare reform. It is a fact!China\\'s media is attacking @ MittRomney while endorsing @ BarackObama   Of course. Mitt knows it\\'s Time To Get Tough. I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself & you can do anything. It\\'s Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us?Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don\\'t like @   prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this?!Only two weeks until we start shooting @ CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year. Congratulations to @ GovMikeHuckabee on last night\\'s tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better. \"Let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me.\" -- @ GovMike HuckabeeThe dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil!\"After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney.\" PaulRyanVPI wonder what @ JoeBiden was thinking last night as @ PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate. Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @ BarackObama\\'s story a big lie. I am impressed with how clearly @ PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @ MittRomney will bring as President. Too busy playing golf? @ BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic signature to the parents of fallen  @ Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment. Of course @ hardball_chris attacked \\'birthers\\' in praising @ CondoleezzaRice\\'s speech. Chris has completely lost it. A fact--golfers don\\'t get aches & pains like others who don\\'t golf. It is amazingly remedial. It\\'s Friday, how many advertisers dropped @ HuffPost today?Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @ BarackObama could have stopped this. \"If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you will never change the outcome.\" -- Michael JordanI loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific!. MittRomney\\'s entire life and career have built prosperity and growth. \"Obama\\'s ideas don\\'t move us \\'Forward,\\' they take us \\'Backwards.\\' These are ideas people come to America to get away from.\" -- @ marcorubio. @ GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night. People love him. We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran. I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @ MittRomney won\\'t let them cheat us anymore.. @ BarackObama\\'s assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China.\" -- @ MittRomneyChina is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade   They stole the technology from us. Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC!Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife. Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not?@ MELANIATRUMP on @ QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces & Jewelry. Tune in at 1AM EST!If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible!I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won\\'t comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone!Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck. As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today... OPEC is having a ball at our expense. It\\'s amazing how much people are enjoying playing at the Trump Scotland course. The dunes are absolutely incredible.   yardstick of quality. Some people aren\\'t used to an environment where excellence is expected.\" -- Steve Jobs. sethmeyers21 bombed again. Didn\\'t get co-host job with @ KellyRipa. He would not have delivered the ratings anyway. Michael S will be great. Slight conflict-- I like @ davidaxelrod--he called me and said great things about my daughter @ IvankaTrump. My # TrumpTuesday @ SquawkCNBC interview discussing the housing market, @ DNC convention & Clint Eastwood\\'s  @washtimes \" The Trump Factor: billionaire leads Republicans in tough fight against Obama\"  by @ EmilyMillerSorry to hear of the passing of @ OfficialMCD. He was a talented actor and a wonderful fiance to my friend @ Omarosa. Will be missed.. @ BillRancic and @ GiulianaRancic should have named their son Donald!Amazing-- CelebApprentice starts filming a record 13th season in just one week. This \\'All Star season will be a big treat for the fans. What a shame @ PennState--lost game--first of many. School legacy is ruined!. andyroddick is playing great tennis in this US Open. I am pulling for him today. The women of # WTA are putting on a great show in this year\\'s US Open. Amazing athletes. My interview with @ fehertwit was the highest rated show in the history of @ GolfChannel. Joe Paterno\\'s family should sue the idiots @ PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report. Why does @ BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride. Is this Hope & Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better...... how does it help to have record high labor day gas prices for them...in Charlotte?!   BarackObama claims to have policies for working people.... @ RobinRoberts of @ GMA is terrific--get better soon. This week the @ DNC convention will deliver hard hits on @ MittRomney. @ RNC will regret being soft on @ BarackObama last week. Smart move by @ BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @ DNC convention keynote. The media can track down @ PaulRyan\\'s old girlfriend and marathon time but can\\'t find @ BarackObama\\'s college applications or other info. Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we\\'re really looking dumb. Lots of $\\'s being made on us. With our national debt passing $16T during the @ DNC convention, @ BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary. NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @ BarackObama, 0% @ MittRomney. Even worse than Hillary\\'s old numbers. Is that racism?China now \\'warns\\' us against being involved in sea  Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @ BarackObama\\'s term. OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @ BarackObama\\'s term. Outrageous!What message does it send when @ BarackObama\\'s campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago?July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year. No surprise. @ BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans  Big mistake!Very good speech by @ MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud!. lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance. Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @ lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?. lancearmstrong, revise your decision to quit--go back and fight. With all the talk of fiscal responsibility at the @ DNC convention yesterday, it was ironic that the debt passed $16T.. @ serenawilliams is a special player. After winning the Gold for the US in the Olympics, it looks like she will (cont)   every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @ Late_Show. It\\'s simple--I get the ratings!I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now. North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte. Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @ BarackObama took office. Have you seen the new # TRUMP line of clothing, apparel and fragrances @ Macy\\'s? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts, etc. The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good!Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him?\"Change before you have to.\" --Jack WelchOther networks are begging me to do a show--I can\\'t because I\\'m doing the Apprentice!Once again under@BarackObama, the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness   We must do better. Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him. Do you really believe he likes @ BarackObama?Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace. Thank you, United States, for making this possible!\"Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt\\'s Campaign\"  @ BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the  we will never know if @ BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient. The delegates at the @ DNC convention keep shouting \"Four More Years. \" Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt?After @ BarackObama\\'s speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released. Remember while @ BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip   They have zero respect for us. Outrageous!\"Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He\\'s added 15 million people.\" -- @ MittRomney\"We\\'ve gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion\" -- @ MittRomneyScary--while @ BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America\\'s history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt. Under @ BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps. The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants, @ GiulianaRancic and me singing \"Call Me Maybe\"  has over 2M views. The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @ MittRomney. Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast!Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty. Today\\'s job report is dismal. Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force. There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible. Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work. Not a real recovery, phony numbersThis chart from AEI\\'s @ JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @ BarackObama\\'s \\'recovery\\' really is:  Disaster. If @ BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2%A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th season Hence, go with your gut!During @ BarackObama\\'s presidency, median family income has fallen 4.8%  Terrible for the middle class. One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade\\'s artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage. I\\'ll be on @ foxandfriends on Monday at 7:30 AM. Tune in!\"You have enemies? Good. That means you\\'ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\" -- Winston ChurchillIn today\\'s # trumpvlog I speak about Clint Eastwood, the # DNC, and Drew Peterson-  to @ serenawilliams.

His last article calling College Football \\'progressive\\' is almost as dumb as his previous on the @ NFLBarack Obama used to mock Bush\\'s 300K monthly job reports   Now Obama wishes he could have a month half as good. Why has Barack Obama repeatedly told inconsistent stories about his religious background?   Who is he?\"You need to overcome the tug of people against you as you reach for high goals.\" --General George S.

The onus of the Chicago teachers\\' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school. Whatever happened to Obama\\'s \\'independent investigation\\' into national security leaks from his administration? Where\\'s the media?84% of US troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there. Why won\\'t Obama release his college applications? Is there something \\'foreign\\' about them?China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands  fundraising and campaigning on our dime, Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel  @ CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base. \"If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party.\" -- @ limbaugh\"There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.\" -- Sun TzuI hope the @ GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won\\'t be with them next time.

Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan--all (cont)  always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again, I was right. Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe. Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job. The Middle East is blowing up--we didn\\'t back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace, (cont)  bad as they were, I don\\'t remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power. What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil. It\\'s Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?OPEC will use yesterday\\'s attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off. So Obama can host the Muslim Brotherhood Pres.

See article: \"Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake\"  of the record 13th season of @ CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates. Obama told @ NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak. Shouldn\\'t there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!What a coincidence that Obama\\'s good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies. The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @ MittRomney. I will be speaking Monday, September 24, (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don\\'t have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?It\\'s Thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @ MittRomney?Obama\\'s convention bounce is gone.

Top selling brand nationwide. Ties, shirts, fragrance-great gifts. QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel. This hits low income families the hardest.

( I\\'m in a magnanimous mood.)It is now clear that the Embassy attack in Libya was a coordinated Al Qaeda operation and not based on some video. Obama\\'s Def.

( @ IvankaTrump agrees)Watch--yesterday Obama continued to evade questions on his security failures in the Benghazi consulate attack. susanvhinds A happy and healthy family. At the Univision forum Obama continued to make excuses for Fast and Furious   His operation killed innocent Americans. I have fun, I love what I do. You should too. Find out how at the National Achievers Conference this October.   premium costs from Obamacare will cost businesses billions  Guess where these new costs get passed to – you....but interestingly, the same people seem to be lucky.

Tune in!@ jtatsuno It\\'s real. A letter from an amazing woman  letter written to one of my many critics!   laurconnors Thank you-- I had a great time. The Ryder Cup will be amazing this week. Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.& his father have done an amazing job... great school & the students were fantasticWhy did @ MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records & applications in return?The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart. Reverend @ JeremiahWright has to be really angry. They threw him aside like he was nothing. Will be doing # TrumpTuesday on @ SquawkCNBC earlier tomorrow (7 AM) as I start shooting @ CelebApprentice. Joe, Becky & Andrew = a great team. With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he\\'s not.@ LibertyU @ MicheleBachmann It was an honor for me. Thank you. My @ foxandfriends interview discussing visiting @ LibertyU, Obama\\'s failed foreign policy and the 2012  @ guardian interview \" This much I know\" discussing business, Prince Harry, Barack Obama and  Emmys were horrendous... the absolute worst show!Despite the Emmy\\'s being terrible as a show, @ jimmykimmel was excellent--and I think his late night show will be a hit. \"Amazing Race\" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows. The Emmys are all politics, that\\'s why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over. All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race. Despite all of China\\'s cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean. With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value. RT @ MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it. Congratulations to Brandt Snedeker on his $11.4M payday on Sunday by winning the Tour Championship and FedEX Cup. Well done. Today I spoke @ LibertyU Convocation, a great crowd... … . @ JulietteTurner, daughter of @ JanineTurner, has written a very informative book, \"Our Constitution Rocks!\"   Age 8 & upScary-- Obama\\'s budget deficits are so out of control that he has to borrow 40 cents on every dollar he spends. Living in denial--only 15% of Democrats think that recent economic news is  your place at the National Achievers Congress in London. It will be an amazing event with a great surprise.   debates are going to have a big impact on the election. @ MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure. Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama. Coincidence? Obama and Ahmadinejad each describe @ Israel\\'s warning over the Iranian nuclear program as just \\'noise\\'  Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit.

Obama\\'s new excuse for his failures is that you \"can\\'t change Washington from the inside. \" Not what he said in \\'09. complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years.

It is actually double that at $1.1T  We can\\'t afford four more years. Sleepy eyes @ chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.

Sadly, after the election!Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun.

Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran. He is desperate. The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…. @ DavidLetterman @ Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist. Thank you David--we are again friends. By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise. How can British PM Cameron spend so much money on Scottish windmills which are ruining the countryside?\"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin.\" -- MittI don\\'t think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod. Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful!Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let\\'s see how he reacts under pressure. \"It doesn\\'t matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. Be careful of voter fraud!27 days until America\\'s greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again. I just had to fire someone, he didn\\'t have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night. Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media?47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird. DELUSIONAL-- Obama actually thought that he won the debate   What is he thinking?Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @ LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine! Great people. Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz\\'s wedding  Do people think this is fair?A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can\\'t perform without drugs. Consumer spending fell in September   Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked. \"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird.\" -- @ MittRomneyI am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China  Obama is killing investment.

New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data  … If Obama\\'s poll numbers continue to fall, I expect him to launch a military strike somewhere before the final debate.. @ Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here  forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment. Get ready- this should be informative and fun! # VPDebateBoth candidates are looking sharp- now it\\'s up to the mouth and the mind. # VPDebateHard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. # VPDebateBiden\\'s sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. # VPDebatePretty even debate but don\\'t force Obama into a war--- he would be the wrong leader. # VPDebateExcellent story on @ MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. # VPDebateBiden\\'s statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. # VPDebatePretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan\\'s closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? # VPDebateGoing over to @ TodayShow now to introduce @ ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch. British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills. \"Wing bangers\"-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can\\'t afford it. Terrible.@ dennisrodman @ ApprenticeNBC Great to have you back for the best season yet!\"There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still.\" -- Pres. Franklin D. RooseveltFirst Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on \"compassionate grounds. \" Do you believe?Doing the @ todayshow with @ MLauer was great- I really like Matt. Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. # VPDebateMy Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me. I\\'m going to the @ Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.. @ dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. Great to hear that our loyal @ CelebApprentice fans are happy with today\\'s announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!With our amazing All Star cast, @ Joan_Rivers, @ johnrich, @ ArsenioOFFICIAL & @ piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. Obama\\'s economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected. \"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. \" -- @ PaulRyanVPVery different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. I look forward to Tuesday night\\'s presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again. When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important. \"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality.\" -- Warren G. BennisI told you, whenever I go to a @ Yankees game the @ Yankees win. When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say \" what were we doing\". Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won. I\\'ll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn\\'t use our(this country\\'s) best people to win. Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series. They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer. Everyone\\'s wondering what\\'s wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup. Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late. So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose. A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.. @ Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence. Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night. A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave. Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won\\'t matter if they win(\"Winning solves all problems\"- (cont)   I wasn\\'t at the @ Yankees game yesterday- can\\'t go today either. When I go, they win. I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.. @ MittRomney\\'s poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn\\'t want to lose the Boeing. I feel guilty not having attended the last two @ yankees games (losses). They would have won!A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people!@ LeighAnnMac Thank you. @ ErichFSchroeder Your dad was a great man & great leader.. @ SbelSbel3555 Sorry, @ piersmorgan is a very smart guy!Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?@ mcginness1 Thanks--a great countryA-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!@ SchroedBoss @ ErichFSchroeder and your parents meant the world to me. @ ArsenioOFFICIAL Why not everyone else is using it--- it\\'s available at @ Macys. In case you missed it, my @ todayshow interview discussing announcing the All Star cast of @  of response on Derek--but I told him his apartment was lucky! -- We love Derek. Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let\\'s face it, it doesn\\'t work- just makes you hungry. I don\\'t get @ JerrySeinfeld\\'s stumbling, bumbling humor--no better than his failed Marriage Ref tv showWing Whackers: the reality is, wind turbines kill birds  it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think. Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history. My @ foxandfriends interview discussing @ JoeBiden\\'s performance, the Libya cover up and tomorrow\\'s crucial  @ antbaxter\\'s documentary on my Scottish golf club was so boring and wrong. He is a small-timer with no talent. The @ brooklynnets logo is plain and boring--but if they win it won\\'t matter. \"Donald Trump announces \\'Celebrity Apprentice\\' All-Stars\"  via @ USATODAYLooking forward to speaking at tonight\\'s gala for @ MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt\\'s doing well. A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn\\'t make the @ yankees any money and he doesn\\'t perform. He is a $30M/ yr rip off. Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family and the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @ FollowTurkey Annual Gala DinnerOnce again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us. \"Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation\"  via @ ABCObama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow\\'s debate  Mitt should bring up college applications & recordsIf @ MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!Tomorrow is # TrumpTuesday @ SquawkCNBC 7:40 AM Tune in!The more Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi, etc you drink, the more weight you gain?Diet Coke, etc is inverse to reason. It tricks your body into eating more. \"Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by.\" Donald J. Trump\"The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government. \" -- @ MittRomneyBased on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate. \"Donald Trump\\'s back with 14 \\'Apprentice\\' All-Stars\"  via @ APGov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @ MittRomney-- Don\\'t waste your vote. Obama must go!@ jbluvx2 Happy Birthday!I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt. Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn\\'t perform well it could be over. I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We\\'ll all be watching @ MittRomney. I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers. Verlander is great but very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games. rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @ Israel if Obama is re-elected. I can confirm the reports-- @ BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @ CelebApprentice.. antbaxter Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent.. @ antbaxter Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful-- you stupid fool!Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked. My # TrumpTuesday @ SquawkCNBC interview discussing the stakes for tonight\\'s debate and the state of my stock  the morons that cause the controversy in Scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated. Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent. Had a great time with @ PaulRyanVP last night on the Intrepid. Paul is terrific. It\\'s amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @ foxnews and @ CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!The Coca Cola company is not happy with me-- that\\'s okay , I\\'ll still keep drinking that garbage. Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight\\'s audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.. @ History\\'s wonderful \"The Men Who Built America\" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing , I\\'ll be live tweeting the debate. @ antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.. @ reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves. Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.. @ washtimes \" @ BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @ realDonaldTrump--\\'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America\\'\" bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called \\'revolution\\' to attack our embassy in Benghazi. Congratulations to @ JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud. DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. Good luck @ MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.. @ MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.@ MissUSA Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job. Get ready for tonight!If the @ yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win!Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @ Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive. For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?@drumline_mormon It is selling great at Macy\\'s--thanks!We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age. They just don\\'t believe we would. I was just told by one of the top @ PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree. Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say \"let\\'s get ready to rumble\"!Why hasn\\'t Obama created jobs?Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?Good response on jobs by @ MittRomney. Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?So far @ MittRomney is winning big.. @ MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential!Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn\\'t he done it? It\\'s all talk. Obama just said @ MittRomney was \"a very successful investor\"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility. Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @ MittRomney is looking strong and sharp. Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He\\'s been Prez 4 years. Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.. MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer. Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done. You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy. Obama better than last time, but again, @ MittRomney wins. Good night. # debateDebate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. George Will said \"best debate he ever saw\". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting. Stupid George Will gave @ MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he\\'s just another dummy. Verlander pitched great, but @ Yankees look truly defeated. At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn\\'t he do it? He lost me a long time ago. Remember, I said Derek don\\'t sell your Trump World Tower apartment... its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot. I still love Derek, he is a winner!Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don\\'t!Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively. Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he\\'ll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don\\'t put it past him!My  has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth. My  followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the \"biggies. \" It\\'s like having your own newspaper. My interview with @ RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @ yankees & how to terminate his contract  marileenelson ThanksVia @ espn: \"Donald Trump would fire A-Rod\" enjoyed discussing @ yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan. Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today\\'s @  turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. Remember, new \"environment friendly\" lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don\\'t care. Robert Bryce @ NYPost-- Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster. If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically. All the guys that said @ MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board. Mitt will remember the early helpers. Obama was beaten but not knocked out. He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...... Bad decisions can be devastating. \"Trump Was Right: \\' Obama\\'s America\\' Tops 2012 Documentaries\"  via @Newsmax_Media. @ MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style. Obama at big debate disadvantage--he just can\\'t get away from his bad record. Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn\\'t he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessaryGeorge Steinbrenner @ yankees would have gotten out of A-Rod\\'s contract three years ago...but put A-Rod in tonight. CC is a great pitcher and can handle pressure-- @ Yankees will win tonight. So far my predictions have all been correct. Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout   He is very selfish!While the @ Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won\\'t quit for CCJoe Girardi @ Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.@ BillRancic Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald. Just read about my friend @ HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles. Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned. Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @ eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback. Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.. @ dubephnx If we didn\\'t remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn\\'t (cont)  @ antbaxter should really be ashamed about his massive box office disaster. Take a hint and get out of the film (cont)  @ mystikangel Bring @ johnrich back? He is back!I find it very sad that we have a President with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful. If Obama goes after Mitt\\'s private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama\\'s college records--all of them. Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10%  Obama did not tell truth last night. Major grudge match this weekend between @ nyjets & @ Patriots. I have a dilemma, I am good friends w/ both Woody (cont)  proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth.. @ashleycam2883 Re: Libya--Hillary took the blame for Obama.

I hope A-Rod plays, however. Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @ Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @ yankee next year, the fans will be happy. Derek Jeter @ yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you. While the next season of @ CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @ Joan_Rivers in the board room.

When Strasburg leaves @ Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?Clinton commented in Ohio today that @ MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama. I always said Bill was an honest man. It\\'s Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?The last time I visited China I couldn\\'t believe all the construction.

Can\\'t wait for @ VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later. No surprise, welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama.   He is the food stamp & welfare \"king\". MittRomney\\'s @ RNC convention came in over $3M under budget. Barack’s @ DNC convention is over $10M in debt. What a surprise!7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday. Real unemployment is at least 15%Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower. Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past. Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion. Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack.

Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @ Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic. \"They succeed, because they think they can.\" -- VirgilSleepy Eyes @ chucktodd owes @ jack_welch an apology. Jack is right on unemployment--the new jobless claims make 7.8% an impossibility. Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama!Derek, get well soon, the @ Yankees need youl.

Congrats to Scotland\\'s Sunday Post Newspaper for its front page article  pic ..com/ e0QVUN0U\"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\" Obama to @ MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal. Obama is an easy target on foreign policy. @ MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden. Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. According to @ SFGate, Obama spoke to Rev. Wright about getting out the black vote   No surprise that they still speak......even though Obama dumped the Reverend like Robert should dump Kristin.. @ bobschieffer will a great job tonight--he is a real pro and respected by both sides. Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama--- just wait and see!I look forward to @ MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi.

I\\'ll be tweeting live. Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.. @ MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. # debateI will be doing @ SquawkCNBC at 7:30.Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down. The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama\\'s failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago   At least someone has done well under Obama. I always said that @ lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. No matter what happens in the election, @ davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record. \"Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director\\'s point of view.\" -- Steven SpielbergLance Armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy. Very sad story--although they caught him red handed. He definitely cheated!Doesn\\'t the US have better things to do than to destroy an American hero for the world to see? Now other (cont)  the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said \"Ok, go get him\"?The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden\\'s death, not Obama, who works hard to take (cont)  @ SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate, my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcement  @ MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate. Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President. China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject!My announcement is tomorrow!Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!Last night was the first time Obama said \"we\" instead of \"I\" in respect to Bin Laden\\'s killing. Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen. I don\\'t have time except to say \"Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!\". bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!Thank you to @ DailyTelegraph reviewer @ NeilMidgley who stated \"\\'You\\'ve Been Trumped\\' was so biased in favour of the protesters......that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump...\". @ BBC should never have played that piece of garbage documentary--& yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course.

This our last chance to get the full record. Third rate @ politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive. Glad to hear @ seanhannity supports my offer to Obama. As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity. What does Obama have to lose?”I just learned that @ politico has no credibility--total phonies that don\\'t report the truth. A puppet of Obama?RT @ APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records  # Election2012I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses. All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American peopleObama has no problem leaking national security secrets. Why can\\'t he release his records? Especially when $5M is going to charity.... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity. In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public... Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @ MittRomney.

He is a very special player and a great guy. New York loves him. @ yankeesChina is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports   We need @ MittRomney to rein them in. Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants \"wind turbines manufactured here in China\"   I don\\'t think this was a gaffe. For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt\\'s tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go.

Going into the lion\\'s den but I\\'ve been there many times before.

I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity. Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi. Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @ TraceAdkins....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause. Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @ Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain..... @ SabrinaSiddiqui Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!@Erizzle05 Only because he has something to hide.@ RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea.@ LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors --Obama should choose that as his $5M charity.

He leads all national polls and Obama\\'s likeability is imploding. VOTE!Be careful of an Obama \"bomb\" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do. Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why?... Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. By the way, where is @ Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah. Pretty audacious for Obama to call @ MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don\\'t have room to write.

Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree. Now grotesque @ BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to become relevant again. I never liked @ BetteMidler\\'s persona or singing and haven\\'t heard her name in years. But whenever she sees me, she kisses my ass. She\\'s disgusting. @ BetteMidler. BetteMidler talks about my hair but I\\'m not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won\\'t. Is this a double standard?While @ BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct. I guess @ BillMaher saw my ratings on the @ Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill, you are no Letterman.. @ BillMaher, who got thrown off ABC for being stupid, is always so nice to me to my face and constantly asking (cont)  people don\\'t know about @ BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont)  not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. Dave Letterman @ Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was \"probably\" born in the US--the word \"probably\" is a disaster for Obama. Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies. I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he (cont)  people walked out on Madonna\\'s concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible!So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let\\'s see what happens later. We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food. Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze.   authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office. All weights are on crane\\'s wrong side --- very precarious below, move out!The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse. I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don\\'t fall for it. Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama\\'s favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday. I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast. People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium --- unlike others, I stayed open.   let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @ MittRomney wants to lower taxes-- need I say more!@ neilmsdunn Dopey, few have built more than me.. MatthewLumby Charity should get the money!The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff!So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!   election is trending towards @ MittRomney. Americans know we can\\'t afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history. My @ extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the  @ SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama  great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes. I never fall for scams. I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview\"Without focus, it\\'s just impossible to be successful at anything.\" --Midas TouchHow did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi?Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday. Glad to hear that @ taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5. Taylor is terrific!@ digiphile @ RedCross RT if you think Pres. Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charityWhy does Obama believe he shouldn\\'t comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.   Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years. 4 more years?Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?China’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses  Their market gains the day we are hit by stormFans shouldn\\'t worry. We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @ CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm. The polls & momentum are trending towards @ MittRomney. Don\\'t let the hurricane change your thinking!Not one Trump building, even those along the Hudson River, lost power --- a testament to quality systems and construction. Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC  President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won\\'t be doing it.

How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ.

In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi.. @ Disney\\'s acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides. Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. Looking at the figures and plans behind @ Disney\\'s acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid @ AOL (cont)  is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records. A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency. I don\\'t blame them. How does a dummy like @ billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink.

The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error!Brian-- Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000  followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @ NBCNightlyNewsBrian, I hope @ NBCNightlyNews isn\\'t paying you too much--look at what\\'s happening to nightly news.

I will and I agree! RT @ ZacharyQuinto @ realdonaldtrump you can\\'t possibly make any more money. so why don\\'t you make a difference instead?!Obama\\'s administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again  Thanks for letting us know nowNo surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama\\'s win. They love a weak America that they can rip off.. @ davidaxelrod I\\'m sending you a check to help find a cure. @ IvankaTrump says hi. With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can. Can get a great deal. At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race. GOP needs to do better!China\\'s Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama\\'s reelection. They have never had it so good. Will own America soon. China\\'s submarines will soon be carrying nukes   They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won\\'t do anything. China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine   They will end up stealing the design from us as usual. Remember to watch the series finale of \"The Men Who Built America\" this Sunday at 8/7c on @ HistoryRomney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio & he would be President. Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn\\'t that ridiculous?Remember to watch the series finale of \"The Men Who Built America\" this Sunday at 8/7c on @ HistoryOf the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I\\'m proud of @ NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention. The election was a major setback for economy.

Your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop. Why do so many people say I hate President Obama —I don’t hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies!. @ antbaxter— Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!. antbaxter— Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?. @ antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof & Aberdeen seeing big benefits.. @ antbaxter I predict somebody is going to sue you!. @ antbaxter Anthony—did you illegally take clips from the Letterman @ Late_Show show and @ GolfChannel without their approval?. antbaxter Only the stupid @ BBC would air your garbage—no wonder they are in such deep trouble.. @ cyndilauper Condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes.

Dumbass @ BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice.. @ BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot, and maybe he will stop making offers he can’t afford.. @ BillMaher’s show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex.. @ HBO should fire @ BillMaher and bring back @ DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.
